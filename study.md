# JavaScript: `javascripting` Review

This study is for your benefit. We do not expect a pull request. Do not fork and
clone. Instead, follow these directions (in order!):

1.  Install `javascripting`

    ```sh
    npm install -g javascripting
    ```

1.  Make a directory, `~/wdi/study/javascripting` to store your work and move
    into that directory.
1.  Initialize a new git repository in that directory.
1.  Create a README ([example](https://github.com/jrhorn424/javascripting))
1.  Add and commit the README, create a remote on GitHub, and push.
1.  Make and checkout a `study` branch off from `master` to work on.
1.  Run `javascripting` from the command line and follow the instructions.
1.  As you work, commit early and often.

## Working Instructions

-   Work in `strict` mode to allow use of `let` and `const` (javascripting's
instructions will instruct you to use `var`).

-   Use commit messages as your learning journal, making notes of challenges and
what you learned by completing each exercise
([example](https://github.com/jrhorn424/learnyounode/commit/5db673a16d4af82d3c5a80240edeb93b0e4dbd0c)).
Then, push the repository to GitHub so future employers can get an idea of your
learning process (not to mention your tenacity!).
